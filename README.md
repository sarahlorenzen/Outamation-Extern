# Outamation AI-Powered Workflow Automation Externship - [Extern](https://www.extern.com/student)
Think AI is all about chatbots and image generators? Think again. In this externship, you’ll explore how AI is transforming massive, messy document workflows into smart, searchable data. From building Python scripts to testing open-source models, you’ll turn unstructured files into usable insights.

## Project 1: How AI Reads and Understands Mortgage Documents
Before AI can process documents, it must first understand them. In this project, you’ll explore Machine Learning, Deep Learning, LLMs, and NLP to see how AI reads and processes text. You’ll also dive into Computer Vision and OCR, learning how AI extracts information from scanned documents. Since this externship focuses on mortgage automation, you’ll study the mortgage industry, its challenges, and why accurate document handling is essential. Finally, you’ll work with a real mortgage "blob" file, analyzing how AI models handle structured and unstructured data. By the end, you’ll have a strong AI foundation and a clear understanding of how AI improves document processing in the mortgage industry.

## Project 2: Learn to Work with Python for AI-Powered Document Processing
AI models require clean, structured data to function effectively. In this project, you’ll learn how to use Python for data processing, cleaning, and organizing mortgage documents to prepare them for AI automation. You’ll begin by exploring Google Colab and learning Python basics. Then, you’ll dive into data preparation techniques to clean and standardize information. Finally, you’ll work with image processing to enhance OCR (Optical Character Recognition) accuracy. By the end of this project, you’ll be able to prepare mortgage data for AI models, ensuring accurate and efficient automation.

#### Step 1: Learn the Basics of Python
The fundamentals of Python and learn how to use Google Colab to run Python code.

#### Step 2: Prepare Your Data for Analysis
Mastering data preparation will help ensure that AI models can extract key information correctly and perform more effectively.

#### Step 3: Process Images Using Python
Learn image processing techniques in Python using OpenCV and PIL. The focus is on preparing images for AI-based document analysis by applying techniques like resizing, denoising, thresholding, and contrast adjustment.

## Project 3: Data Extraction from Documents Using Python
Before AI can make sense of documents, it needs clean, structured data. In this project, you’ll learn how to turn both digital and scanned PDFs into machine-readable formats using Python. You’ll explore tools like PyMuPDF and pdfplumber to extract text from multi-page mortgage files. Then, you’ll apply field heuristics—like regex patterns, anchor phrases, and layout clues—to identify key fields such as borrower name, salary, and loan amount.

#### Step 1: Extract Text from Multi-Page PDFs Using Python
Learn how to turn messy and unorganized mortgage documents into clean, usable data using Python. 

#### Step 2: Identify Fields Using Regex and Anchor Phrases
Learn how to use regex patterns, anchor phrases, bounding boxes, and advanced PyMuPDF functions to extract meaningful data from complex layouts. You’ll also learn how to work with tabular structures using PyMuPDF’s table detection methods.

## Project 4: Advanced OCR Comparison and Layout-Aware Extraction
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is at the heart of document intelligence. In this project, you’ll get hands-on with three OCR engines— Tesseract, PaddleOCR, and EasyOCR —to see how they perform on complex mortgage documents. You’ll start by learning how to clean and extract text from scanned PDFs using Tesseract. Then, you’ll explore layout-aware tools that better preserve formatting and structure. Finally, you’ll run comparisons and recommend the most effective tool for real-world automation. By the end, you’ll be able to confidently select and justify OCR tools based on both technical and business needs.
